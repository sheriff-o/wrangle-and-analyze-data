    "Generally Data Wrangling involves three steps which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gathering Data \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assessing the gathered data and;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cleaning the data\n",
    "\n",
    "all these three steps were adequately followed during the course of my Data Wrangling Project using the WeRateDogs Twitter data as highlighted below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "I gathered data from three different sources, each one is stored in separate files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first file was manually downloaded from a given link named \"twitter_archive_enhanced.csv\". This was uploaded into my working directory and then read into a pandas DataFrame and called twitter_archive_enhanced_df.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second file was a tsv file hosted on Udacity's servers. It was downloaded programmatically using Python's Requests library and the given url \"https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv\".\n",
    "The content of the request's response was written into a file called \"image_predictions.tsv\"  that is, the last part of the url. This file was also read into a pandas DataFrame and called image_predictions_df.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third file was supposed to be contain the data collected by querying Twitter's API. But the approval to do that was not granted by Twitter. So I ended up download the tweet-json.txt file provided as alternative for use. This was used to create a pandas DataFrame called tweet_json_df. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "I assessed each of the data both visually and programmatically to be able to detect the issues in the data. Following the assessment, eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues as stated below were detected and documented. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality issues\n",
    "1. twitter_archive_enhanced_df table: Contains features that are not relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. twitter_archive_enhanced_df table: Has erroneous datatype (timestamp).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. twitter_archive_enhanced_df table: Some dog name contains unidentified values such as a, an, just, such etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. twitter_archive_enhanced_df table: Some records have rating_denominator of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. image_predictions_df table: Has columns with names that are NOT descriptive, such as p1, p1_conf, p1_dog and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. image_predictions_df table: Lack of consistency in the naming in columns p1, p2 and p3.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. image_predictions_df table: Contains breeds that are not dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. tweet_json_df table: Erroneous datatype (tweet_id).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness issues\n",
    "1. twitter_archive_enhanced_df table: Rating is taking two columns instead of one. This violates the requirements for tidiness\n",
    "\n",
    "2. twitter_archive_enhanced_df table: The 'text' column also contains url at the end of each text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "All the issues documented were cleaned following the programmatic cleaning process: Define, Code and Test in other to improve quality and tidiness. The cleaning activities include:\n",
    "\n",
    ". Deleted features or columns that are not relevant for the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Changed the datatype of the timestamp column.\n",
    "\n",
    ". Removed unidentied values from the name column\n",
    "\n",
    ". Deleted record with rating_denominator of 0\n",
    "\n",
    ". Renamed the p columns\n",
    "\n",
    ". Ensured consistency in the naming in the p columns\n",
    "\n",
    ". Deleted breeds that are not dogs\n",
    "\n",
    ". Datatype casting\n",
    "\n",
    ". Created a single column for rating, and deleted the previous ones\n",
    "\n",
    ". Removed the url at the end of every text in the text column\n",
    "\n",
    "I merged the three files to have a single file and stored it in my current directory with the name \"twitter_archive_master.csv\".\n"
